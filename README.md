# InterAppSample

With the Viva Wallet card terminal app for iOS it is possible to receive requests for initiating transactions from third-party apps installed on the same iOS mobile device. Communication with the Card Terminal App is done through the use of URL schemes. When the Card Terminal Appâ€™s pay flow finishes it returns the transaction result to the caller app.
